# Decision_tree-random_forest-example
In this project we predict that the borrower is capable or not to pay his/her loan fully to bank.

First I analyse the data and apply some feature engineering of the data then apply decisiontree classifier and show the results and got evaluation metrics according to the predictions.
Then to improve results I used randomforest classifer on same data and then compare the evation matrix with previous solution.
